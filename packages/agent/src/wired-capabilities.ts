/**
 * B-069/B-070/B-071 — what the agent ACTUALLY wired, as opposed to what config asked for.
 *
 * Three items each needed a listing, and the obvious implementation for each was to re-read the
 * config from the surface. Their shared DoD bullet refuses that, in the same words: "the listing
 * comes from what was actually wired, not from re-reading the config file — those two can disagree,
 * and the disagreement is the bug worth catching." B-071 was REOPENED for shipping the re-read.
 *
 * So this is derived from the values the builder itself receives, at the point it receives them —
 * the same `posture`, `cfg` and loaded MCP map that reach `.mcp()`, `.skills()` and `.hooks()`.
 * Pure and parameterized: it performs no I/O, which is what makes "no second read" checkable rather
 * than promised.
 *
 * Built ONCE for every consumer. Building it privately per command is what B-085 had to undo for
 * the composer, and there would have been four of them.
 *
 * B-108 — the derivation is now `@theokit/sdk`'s `recordWiring`, which takes the trust posture as
 * its gate. What stays here is this product's shape: which three capabilities are lists of NAMES
 * (the posture gates eight things, and durable memory is not a list), plus the two fields that are
 * not entities at all — whether project sources loaded, and which sandbox mode the build was given.
