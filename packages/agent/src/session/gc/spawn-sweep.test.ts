/**
 * B-142 — the sweep runs in another process, because `void` cannot make synchronous work async.
 *
 * An independent review measured the trigger against the tree this repository itself cites as
 * measured (13 269 projects, `filesystem.ts:31-38`): the event loop was blocked for **37.1 s cold
 * and 4.9–13.2 s warm**. `planAllProjectsOnDisk` is `async`, but its body runs synchronously until
 * the first `await`, and `classifyProjects` is invoked eagerly while the argument object is built —
 * so `void collectSessionsAutomatically(...)` deferred the tail and the tail was empty. The comment
 * in `main.tsx` claiming "housekeeping must never be something the operator waits for" was false on
 * the only tree size anyone had measured.
 *
 * There is no in-process fix: the sweep is synchronous JavaScript inside a dependency, and no
 * amount of scheduling makes a synchronous block yield. Another process is the mechanism.
 *
 * What it runs is the command that already exists — `sessions gc --all-projects` — rather than a
 * second implementation of the delete path. The parent still owns the DECISION (enabled, interval,
 * first-run-is-a-dry-run); the child only does the work.
