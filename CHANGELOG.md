## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The agent now introduces itself as TheoCode, on the SDK it actually runs on. It was calling itself "Theokit Builder" in the system prompt, the greeting, the banner, the composer placeholder and the directory-trust dialog — the last of which asked for filesystem and command-execution permission in the name of a product that does not exist (B-002)
- Pressing ESC on a pending question now unblocks the turn immediately. The question was removed from the screen but never withdrawn from the agent, so the model kept waiting on it for five minutes while the interface showed it as gone (B-004)
- The "a question is already pending" error now reads in English and can be caught by type from the package entrypoint, instead of being reachable only by matching its message (B-004)
- Tightening the sandbox mode now ends shell sessions already running under the looser one. A `bash -i` started with full access survived a switch to read-only, still interactive under the permissive wrap (B-014)
- A failed background write of the session pointer or goal state no longer terminates the terminal UI; it degrades and reports the reason instead (B-013)
- Local runtime state under `.theocode/` is ignored by git again. Two rules cancelled each other out, so sessions and the resolved config were committable despite being declared local (B-017)
- The file that records which directories you trust and which hook commands you pre-approved is now refused when other local users can write it, and its directory is repaired to be private if something else created it first (B-005)
- A delegated sub-agent can no longer be handed tools with the sandbox silently omitted. The scope treated a missing sandbox as "run without one" rather than as an error, so the shell it built was unconfined with no warning (B-006)
- A project's config file can no longer widen the sandbox or switch approvals off over the user's own setting. Both keys ranked below `project` and `env` in precedence, so a cloned repository could grant itself full access; tightening is still allowed, and an explicit command-line flag still wins (B-006)
- The terminal UI no longer auto-approves commands when no sandbox is actually enforcing anything. It approved every command under `full-auto` while the same screen warned that confinement was absent — the headless surface had refused this combination all along (B-006)
- Forking a session now also protects the most recent transcript, not just the one the pointer names — the session most likely still being appended to was absent from the guard (B-003)
- A transcript that is being written to right now is no longer eligible for deletion. Cleanup consulted the cross-process writer lease in neither phase, so only the file's age stood between a live session and removal (B-003)
- Session cleanup now refuses to run when it cannot read which session is live, instead of treating an unreadable pointer as "no session is live" and proceeding to delete (B-003)
- The ACP surface no longer registers `request_user_input`, a tool it could not answer — every such call used to stall for five minutes waiting on a bridge only the terminal UI listens to (B-001)
- An authentication failure now surfaces as an authentication failure instead of being passed downstream as an empty key, which made the real cause resurface later as an unrelated provider error (B-007)

### Removed

- Dead surface: an unused drain helper, an orphan temp-file sweeper that hard-coded a private SDK naming convention, a statically unreachable assertion, and four exported readers with no callers — 174 lines (B-016)

- The unused `apiKey()` accessor and the transport dependency it fed: it was threaded through two modules and never read (B-007)

### Added

- `BACKLOG.md` — the single maintenance registry for TheoCode, seeded with 17 items derived from the TheoCode ↔ theokit cross-validation of 2026-08-07 (`.claude/knowledge-base/reviews/theokit-crossval-review-2026-08-07.md`)
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file, required by Unbreakable Rule 6 and recorded as finding CI-010 in that same review
